# Frontend UI/UX Security Review

## Summary

This review examined the frontend applications (RN Dashboard, Patient Portal, Employer Dashboard) for security issues related to input validation, secure session handling, form abuse protections, XSS, CSRF, and authentication flows.

## Findings

### RN Dashboard (`src/frontend/rn-dashboard`)

1.  **Missing Authentication Implementation**: 
    *   The `Login.js` component is a placeholder and does not implement any login logic.
    *   The main `App.js` sets up routes (`/`, `/rn`, `/md`, `/employer`, `/md/dashboard`) but does **not** implement any route protection. All routes appear publicly accessible without authentication.
    *   The `EscalatedAlertsPanel.js` component imports and uses a `useAuth` hook (`const { token } = useAuth();`) to get an authentication token for API calls and WebSocket connections.
    *   However, a search revealed that **no `useAuth.js` hook or equivalent authentication context/provider exists** within the `rn-dashboard` source code. The `AuthContext.js` found belongs to the `Ojala.Web` project.
    *   **Conclusion**: This indicates a critical security flaw. The dashboard attempts to use authentication tokens but lacks the actual mechanism to obtain, manage, or validate them. Sensitive API endpoints and WebSocket connections might be accessed without proper authentication, or the application may be non-functional due to the missing hook.

2.  **Input Validation**: No explicit client-side input validation logic was found in the reviewed components (e.g., `EscalatedAlertsPanel`). Reliance seems to be placed on backend validation, which is necessary but insufficient on its own.

3.  **Session Handling**: Due to the missing authentication mechanism, secure session handling (e.g., token storage, refresh mechanisms, secure logout) is not implemented.

4.  **XSS/CSRF**: 
    *   No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` was found, reducing direct XSS risks from React rendering.
    *   Standard fetch calls are used, which are generally protected from CSRF by browser same-origin policies, but explicit CSRF token protection (e.g., via custom headers checked by the backend) is not evident.

### Patient Portal (`src/frontend/Ojala.PatientPortal`)

*   *(Review pending)*

### Employer Dashboard (`src/frontend/employer-dashboard`)

*   *(Review pending)*

## Recommendations

1.  **Implement Authentication (RN Dashboard)**: Urgently implement a robust authentication mechanism for the RN Dashboard. This should include:
    *   A proper Login component with secure credential handling.
    *   An authentication context or hook (`useAuth`) to manage user sessions and tokens.
    *   Secure token storage (e.g., HttpOnly cookies managed by the backend, or secure browser storage with appropriate safeguards).
    *   Protected routes that redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
    *   Secure logout functionality.
2.  **Implement Client-Side Validation**: Add client-side input validation to all forms to provide immediate feedback and reduce invalid requests to the backend.
3.  **Implement CSRF Protection**: Ensure the backend API implements and validates anti-CSRF tokens, especially for state-changing requests, and that the frontend includes these tokens in relevant requests.
4.  **Review Other Frontends**: Conduct a similar detailed review of the Patient Portal and Employer Dashboard for authentication, authorization, input validation, and other UI security concerns.

## Next Steps

- Document these findings in the main audit summary.
- Update `todo.md`.
- Proceed with the UI/UX review for Patient Portal and Employer Dashboard.
