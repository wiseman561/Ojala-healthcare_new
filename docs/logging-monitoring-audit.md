# Logging and Monitoring Audit

## Summary

This audit reviewed the logging and monitoring practices within the Ojalá Healthcare Platform, focusing on HIPAA compliance requirements for secure logging without PHI leakage.

## Findings

1. **Basic Logging Configuration Only**: All services (Ojala.Api, Ojala.ApiGateway, Ojala.Identity, ai-engine, nurse-assistant) use only the default ASP.NET Core or Node.js logging configuration with basic log levels:
   ```json
   "Logging": {
     "LogLevel": {
       "Default": "Information",
       "Microsoft": "Warning",
       "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **No Centralized Logging Solution**: There is no evidence of a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Azure Application Insights, AWS CloudWatch) being configured in any of the services.

3. **No PHI Sanitization**: No code or configuration was found that would sanitize or redact PHI from logs, creating a significant risk of PHI leakage in log files.

4. **No Audit Trail Implementation**: Despite the frontend showing an "AuditLogViewerCard" component, this appears to use mock data. No actual audit logging implementation was found in the backend services.

5. **No Security Event Monitoring**: No configuration for security event monitoring, alerting, or intrusion detection was found.

6. **No Log Retention Policies**: No evidence of log retention policies or log rotation configuration that would comply with HIPAA's requirement to maintain logs for at least 6 years.

7. **Frontend Claims vs. Reality**: The frontend UI claims to have "blockchain-secured audit logs" but no actual implementation of this was found in the codebase.

## HIPAA Compliance Gaps

1. **§164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D) - Information System Activity Review**: HIPAA requires regular review of system activity, including audit logs and access reports. The current implementation lacks proper audit logging.

2. **§164.312(b) - Audit Controls**: HIPAA requires implementing hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems containing PHI. The platform lacks these controls.

3. **§164.312(c)(1) - Integrity**: HIPAA requires protecting PHI from improper alteration or destruction. Without proper audit trails, unauthorized changes cannot be detected.

4. **§164.312(c)(2) - Authentication**: HIPAA requires corroborating that PHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner. The lack of integrity verification in logs fails this requirement.

## Recommendations

1. **Implement Centralized Logging**: 
   - Deploy a centralized logging solution like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based solution like Azure Application Insights.
   - Configure all services to send logs to this central repository.

2. **PHI Protection in Logs**:
   - Implement log sanitization to automatically redact or hash PHI in logs.
   - Create a whitelist of fields that can be logged and ensure all other fields are sanitized.
   - Use structured logging with specific fields marked as sensitive.

3. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**:
   - Implement proper audit logging for all access to PHI, including:
     - User identification
     - Timestamp
     - Action performed
     - Resource accessed
     - Success/failure status
     - Source IP address

4. **Log Retention and Security**:
   - Implement log rotation and archiving policies that maintain logs for at least 6 years.
   - Ensure logs are stored securely with encryption at rest.
   - Implement access controls for log data.

5. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Configure alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts, unusual data access patterns).
   - Implement a security information and event management (SIEM) solution.

6. **Implement Log Integrity Verification**:
   - Use cryptographic methods to ensure log integrity.
   - If blockchain-based audit logs are desired (as claimed in the UI), implement a proper solution rather than just mocking it.

## Next Steps

- Document these findings in the main audit summary.
- Update `todo.md`.
- Prioritize implementing centralized logging with PHI protection as a critical security enhancement.
