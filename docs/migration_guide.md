## Migration Overview

The migration to OjalaHealthcarePlatform follows a carefully planned, phased approach designed to minimize risk and ensure continuity of service. The migration encompasses:

- Data migration from legacy databases to new data stores
- User account transition with seamless authentication
- Gradual feature rollout using feature flags
- Parallel operation of legacy and new systems during transition
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Clear rollback procedures in case of issues

## Phased Migration Approach

### Phase 1: Infrastructure and Foundation (Months 0-3)

- Deploy core infrastructure components (AWS, Vault, monitoring)
- Implement API Gateway for routing between legacy and new systems
- Set up CI/CD pipelines and deployment workflows
- Establish data synchronization mechanisms
- Deploy authentication bridge for seamless user experience

**Success Criteria:**
- Infrastructure provisioned and operational
- API Gateway successfully routing requests
- Authentication bridge validating legacy tokens
- Monitoring systems collecting baseline metrics

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Migration (Months 3-6)

- Migrate patient data management functionality
- Implement new RN and MD dashboards
- Deploy AI integration services
- Migrate care plan management
- Begin user migration for pilot groups

**Success Criteria:**
- Core clinical workflows operational in new system
- Data synchronization maintaining consistency
- Pilot users successfully using new interfaces
- Performance metrics meeting or exceeding targets

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Complete Transition (Months 6-12)

- Migrate employer and patient portals
- Implement advanced analytics and reporting
- Complete user migration
- Decommission legacy components as appropriate
- Optimize performance and scalability

**Success Criteria:**
- All users migrated to new platform
- All critical functionality available in new system
- Legacy systems properly archived or decommissioned
- Performance and reliability metrics exceeding targets

## Data Migration

### Data Assessment and Preparation

1. **Data Inventory**: Catalog all data sources, schemas, and volumes
2. **Data Cleansing**: Identify and resolve data quality issues
3. **Schema Mapping**: Define mappings between legacy and new schemas
4. **Test Migration**: Perform test migrations with subset of data

### Migration Approaches

#### ETL Processes

- Batch migration for historical data
- Custom ETL jobs for complex transformations
- Data validation and reconciliation procedures
- Audit logging of all migration activities

#### Real-time Synchronization

- Change Data Capture (CDC) for ongoing synchronization
- Dual-write patterns for critical data during transition
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Monitoring and alerting for synchronization issues

### Data Validation

- Automated validation of migrated data
- Statistical analysis of data distributions
- Manual spot-checking of critical records
- Reconciliation reports for stakeholder review

## User Migration

### User Account Transition

1. **User Inventory**: Catalog all users, roles, and permissions
2. **Account Mapping**: Map legacy accounts to new identity structure
3. **Credential Management**: Securely transition authentication credentials
4. **Permission Alignment**: Ensure appropriate access in new system

### Authentication Bridge

- Seamless authentication across legacy and new systems
- Token validation and translation
- Single sign-on experience for users
- Gradual transition of authentication authority

### User Communication and Training

- Targeted communications based on user role
- Role-specific training materials and sessions
- Support resources during transition
- Feedback mechanisms for user experience issues

## Integration Points

### API Gateway Integration

- Centralized routing of requests between systems
- Transparent proxying of legacy API calls
- Request/response transformation as needed
- Gradual shifting of traffic to new endpoints

### Legacy System Connectors

- Purpose-built adapters for legacy systems
- Data format translation and normalization
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Monitoring and logging of integration points

### Third-party Integrations

- Migration of external system integrations
- Updated authentication and authorization
- API version management
- Testing and validation of external connections

## Feature Flag Strategy

### Controlled Rollout

- Feature flags for all new functionality
- Granular control at feature, user, and role levels
- A/B testing capabilities for UI changes
- Metrics collection for feature usage and performance

### Implementation Approach

1. **Define Flags**: Identify all features requiring controlled rollout
2. **Configure Defaults**: Set appropriate default values
3. **User Targeting**: Define user segments for gradual enablement
4. **Monitoring**: Track feature usage and performance metrics

### Rollout Phases

- Internal testing with development and QA teams
- Limited beta with selected power users
- Department-by-department enablement
- Full production rollout

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Triggers

- Predefined thresholds for error rates and performance
- User impact assessment criteria
- Data integrity validation failures
- Security or compliance concerns

### Rollback Process

1. **Decision Making**: Clear escalation path and decision authority
2. **Communication**: Templates and channels for stakeholder notification
3. **Technical Rollback**: Procedures for reverting to previous state
4. **Verification**: Validation steps to confirm successful rollback

### Component-level Rollbacks

- API Gateway route reversal
- Feature flag disablement
- Database rollback procedures
- Infrastructure state restoration
