## Security Architecture

The OjalaHealthcarePlatform employs a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

### Infrastructure Security

- AWS infrastructure with security groups and network ACLs
- Private subnets for database and application tiers
- Bastion hosts for secure administrative access
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection

### Application Security

- Input validation and output encoding
- Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices and code reviews
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning

### API Security

- API Gateway with rate limiting and throttling
- JWT-based authentication
- Request validation and sanitization
- API versioning and deprecation policies

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- MFA support for administrative accounts
- Risk-based authentication for sensitive operations
- Secure password policies and storage

### Role-Based Access Control

- Granular permission model based on user roles
- Principle of least privilege
- Segregation of duties for administrative functions
- Contextual access controls based on user, device, and location

### Single Sign-On

- Integration with enterprise identity providers
- SAML and OAuth/OIDC support
- Centralized session management
- Automatic session timeout and revocation

## Data Protection

### Encryption

- TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Database-level encryption with AWS KMS
- Field-level encryption for PHI

### Data Masking and Anonymization

- Automatic masking of sensitive data in logs and reports
- Data anonymization for analytics and research
- Configurable data retention policies
- Secure data deletion procedures

### Secrets Management

- HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets storage
- Automatic key rotation
- Just-in-time access to credentials
- Audit logging for all secrets access

## Network Security

### Network Segmentation

- VPC segmentation with security groups
- Micro-segmentation for container workloads
- Internal API endpoints not exposed to public internet
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for public endpoints

### Traffic Filtering

- TLS termination at load balancers
- Deep packet inspection
- IP allowlisting for administrative functions
- Geo-blocking for suspicious regions

### Secure Communication

- Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- API Gateway for external API access
- VPN for remote administrative access
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time features

## Compliance Framework

### HIPAA Compliance

- Business Associate Agreements (BAA) with cloud providers
- PHI inventory and data flow mapping
- Access controls and audit logging
- Encryption of PHI at rest and in transit

### GDPR Compliance

- Data subject access request (DSAR) handling
- Consent management
- Data minimization practices
- Right to be forgotten implementation

### SOC 2 Compliance

- Security, availability, and confidentiality controls
- Regular control testing and validation
- Third-party audits and certifications
- Continuous compliance monitoring

## Security Monitoring

### Logging and Auditing

- Centralized logging with Elasticsearch
- Immutable audit trails
- User activity monitoring
- Privileged access monitoring

### Threat Detection

- Real-time anomaly detection
- Behavioral analysis
- Intrusion detection systems
- Vulnerability scanning

### Alerting and Response

- 24/7 security monitoring
- Automated alerts for security events
- Escalation procedures
- Integration with incident response workflow

## Incident Response

### Incident Management

- Defined incident response procedures
- Severity classification and escalation paths
- Communication templates and protocols
- Post-incident analysis and reporting

### Breach Notification

- Automated detection of potential data breaches
- Notification workflows compliant with regulations
- Documentation and evidence preservation
- Regulatory reporting procedures

### Business Continuity

- Disaster recovery planning
- Regular backup testing
- Failover procedures
- Service level objectives for recovery

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Testing

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Software composition analysis
- Container security scanning

### Penetration Testing

- Regular external penetration testing
- Internal security assessments
- Red team exercises
- Bug bounty program

### Compliance Verification

- Automated compliance checks
- Security control validation
- Configuration auditing
