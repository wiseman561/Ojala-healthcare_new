# Ojalá Healthcare Platform - Security Audit Summary

**Date:** 2025-04-29
**Branch:** `feature/security-audit-hardening`

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the findings of a comprehensive security audit and hardening process performed on the Ojalá Healthcare Platform. The audit covered dependencies, codebase quality, Docker configurations, API security, access controls, encryption, logging, CI/CD pipelines, third-party integrations, cloud infrastructure (via IaC), and UI/UX security, following HIPAA, SOC 2, and OWASP best practices.

## 2. Summary of Findings and Actions

### 2.1. Dependency and Codebase Audit

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   Numerous high and critical vulnerabilities were found across multiple Node.js projects via `npm audit` (e.g., `Ojala.Web`: 152 vulns, `rn-dashboard`: 68 vulns). Details are logged in `audit_*.txt` files and summarized in `CHANGELOG.md`.
    *   Initial disk space issues (inode exhaustion) hampered `npm audit fix` but were resolved.
*   **Fixes Applied**: 
    *   `npm audit fix` was run on several projects (e.g., `ai-engine`, `Ojala.AlertsStreamer`).
    *   Targeted dependency updates were performed for `rn-dashboard` (`semver`, `webpack-dev-middleware`, `serialize-javascript`).
    *   ESLint was installed and configured for `ai-engine`, and auto-fixes were applied. Manual fixes were made for parsing errors.
*   **Remaining Issues**: 
    *   Many vulnerabilities remain, particularly in frontend projects (`Ojala.Web`, `rn-dashboard`, `employer-dashboard`, `patient-app`), requiring further manual updates or dependency upgrades, potentially involving breaking changes.
    *   Linting needs to be run and configured for all other Node.js projects.
    *   .NET dependency audit was not performed as part of this scope but is recommended.

### 2.2. Docker Image and Container Security

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   Direct image scanning with Trivy was not possible due to environment limitations.
    *   Dockerfile audit revealed:
        *   Use of non-specific base image tags (`latest`, `node:18`).
        *   Missing non-root user configurations.
        *   Lack of pinned versions in package installations.
        *   Inefficient layering and potential inclusion of build tools/source code in final images.
        *   Missing `.dockerignore` files or overly broad `COPY` commands.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None directly applied to Dockerfiles yet. Detailed recommendations provided.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Dockerfiles require significant hardening based on recommendations in `/docs/hardening-guidelines.md`.

### 2.3. API Security (Rate Limiting & Auth)

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   No rate limiting was configured initially.
    *   Authorization checks (`AuthenticationSchemes = "Bearer"`) were present on some Ocelot routes but not consistently applied or verified across all sensitive endpoints.
*   **Fixes Applied**: 
    *   Granular rate limiting (per client ID, per route) was added to `ocelot.json` in the API Gateway.
    *   Confirmed `AuthenticationProviderKey` is set for relevant routes.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Requires testing to confirm effectiveness. Rate limits need tuning based on expected traffic.

### 2.4. Frontend Access Control

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   **Critical**: `rn-dashboard` lacks any functional authentication mechanism. `Login.js` is a placeholder, routes are unprotected, and the referenced `useAuth` hook is missing.
    *   No evidence of role-based access control (RBAC) enforcement in the reviewed `rn-dashboard` components.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Requires significant implementation effort.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Authentication and RBAC need to be implemented across all relevant frontend applications (RN Dashboard, Patient Portal, Employer Dashboard).

### 2.5. Encryption of Sensitive Data

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   **Critical**: `RequireHttpsMetadata = false` in API Gateway and Identity service allows token transmission over HTTP.
    *   **Critical**: No evidence of database encryption at rest (TDE or column-level) for PHI in `OjalaDbContext.cs`.
    *   Frontend "secure messaging" relies solely on HTTPS, lacking end-to-end or client-side encryption.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Requires configuration changes and potentially database schema updates.
*   **Remaining Issues**: HTTPS must be enforced (`RequireHttpsMetadata = true`). Encryption at rest for the database is essential for HIPAA compliance.

### 2.6. Logging and Monitoring

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   Logging appears inconsistent and not centralized.
    *   Default logging levels (Information) might log sensitive data.
    *   No evidence of PHI filtering/sanitization in logs.
    *   Lack of comprehensive audit trails for security-relevant events.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Recommendations provided.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Implement centralized, structured logging (e.g., Serilog sinks to ELK/Splunk), configure log levels appropriately, implement PHI filtering, and create detailed audit trails.

### 2.7. CI/CD Pipeline Security

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   CodeQL scanning was not active.
    *   Dependency scanning (OWASP Dependency-Check) existed but wasn't integrated into the main CI/CD flow.
    *   No container image scanning in the pipeline.
*   **Fixes Applied**: 
    *   Added a new GitHub Actions workflow (`codeql-analysis.yml`) for SAST scanning.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Integrate dependency scanning and container image scanning into the build pipeline, configure failure conditions based on severity, pin action versions, and review workflow permissions.

### 2.8. Third-Party Integrations

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   While Vault usage is positive, confirmation is needed that *all* secrets (Stripe, Email/SMS) are fetched from Vault and not hardcoded elsewhere.
    *   Stripe secret key handling needs verification (must be backend-only).
    *   HealthKit `deviceToken` stored in potentially insecure `AsyncStorage`.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Recommendations provided.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Verify secret fetching logic. Evaluate `deviceToken` storage security.

### 2.9. Cloud Infrastructure Security (IaC Review)

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   **Critical**: Hardcoded Vault tokens and database passwords in `docker-compose.yml` and Helm `values.yaml` (including `values-prod.yaml`).
    *   Insecure development configurations (Vault dev mode, exposed ports).
    *   Missing Kubernetes Network Policies.
    *   Lack of mTLS for internal service communication.
    *   No explicit configuration for storage encryption at rest.
    *   Insufficient container security contexts in non-production environments.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Recommendations provided.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Requires significant refactoring to remove hardcoded secrets, implement network policies, enforce security contexts, and configure storage encryption, ideally using Vault Kubernetes auth and Kubernetes secrets.

### 2.10. UI/UX Security Review

*   **Vulnerabilities Found**: 
    *   **Critical**: Missing authentication in `rn-dashboard` (see 2.4).
    *   Lack of client-side input validation.
    *   No explicit CSRF protection mechanisms identified.
*   **Fixes Applied**: None. Recommendations provided.
*   **Remaining Issues**: Implement authentication, input validation, and CSRF protection across all frontends.

## 3. Overall Assessment and Recommendations

The Ojalá Healthcare Platform contains several **critical security vulnerabilities** that must be addressed before handling real PHI or deploying to production. Key areas requiring immediate attention include:

1.  **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement robust authentication and RBAC across all frontends and ensure consistent authorization checks on backend APIs.
2.  **Secret Management**: Eliminate all hardcoded credentials by properly integrating Vault with Kubernetes (using Kubernetes Auth Method) and utilizing Kubernetes Secrets.
3.  **Encryption**: Enforce HTTPS (`RequireHttpsMetadata=true`) and implement encryption at rest for the database containing PHI.
4.  **Network Security**: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to enforce least privilege network access between services.
5.  **Dependency Management**: Address the high number of vulnerable dependencies, particularly in frontend projects.
6.  **Secure Configurations**: Harden Dockerfiles, Kubernetes configurations, and CI/CD pipelines as per the guidelines in `/docs/hardening-guidelines.md`.

It is strongly recommended to prioritize these fixes and conduct a third-party penetration test before go-live.
