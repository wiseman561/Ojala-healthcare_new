# Docker Security Audit - nurse-assistant

## Security Issues Found

1.  **Outdated Node.js base image**: Uses `node:16-slim`. Node.js 16 reached End-of-Life in September 2023 and no longer receives security updates. This poses a significant security risk.
2.  **Unpinned Node.js base image version**: Using `node:16-slim` without a specific patch version tag allows for potential dependency drift when rebuilding.
3.  **No vulnerability scanning during build**: No security scanning is integrated into the build process.

## Recommendations

1.  **Update base image to current LTS**: Change `FROM node:16-slim` to a current, supported LTS version like `FROM node:20-slim` (or the latest LTS available).
2.  **Pin base image versions precisely**: Use a specific patch version, e.g., `FROM node:20.13.1-slim`.
3.  **Add .dockerignore file**: Ensure a `.dockerignore` file exists in the `nurse-assistant` directory to prevent unnecessary files (like `.git`, local `node_modules`, etc.) from being included in the build context, reducing image size and potential attack surface.
4.  **Implement security scanning** during the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities in the base image and dependencies.
5.  **Consider removing npm** in the final stage if not needed at runtime, further reducing the attack surface.

## Positive Security Practices Already Implemented

1.  **Multi-stage build**: Reduces final image size by separating build dependencies.
2.  **Non-root user**: Creates and switches to `appuser` to run the application, following the principle of least privilege.
3.  **Uses `npm ci --only=production`**: Installs only necessary production dependencies in the final stage, minimizing bloat and attack surface.
4.  **Health check**: Implemented to monitor container health.
5.  **Proper ownership**: Sets file ownership to the non-root user.
