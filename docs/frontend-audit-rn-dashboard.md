# Frontend Access Control Audit - RN Dashboard

## Findings

1.  **Incomplete Implementation**: Key components like `Login.js` and `RNDashboard.js` appear to be placeholders with no functional code.
2.  **No Route Protection**: The main routing file (`App.js`) defines routes for different roles (`/rn`, `/md`, `/employer`) but lacks any mechanism (e.g., private routes, route guards) to enforce authentication or role-based access before rendering these components.
3.  **No Centralized Auth State**: No evidence of a dedicated authentication context (`AuthContext.js`, `UserProvider.js`) or state management (like Redux/Zustand) for handling user sessions or roles was found.
4.  **Token Storage**: The `TelehealthScheduleList.js` component retrieves the authentication token directly from `localStorage`. Storing JWTs in `localStorage` is generally discouraged due to XSS vulnerabilities. Secure alternatives like HttpOnly cookies are preferred.
5.  **Limited Role Checks**: While API calls might implicitly filter data based on the user's token on the backend, there's no visible frontend logic enforcing role-based access to specific UI elements or routes within the examined components.

## Recommendations

1.  **Implement Proper Authentication Flow**: Complete the `Login.js` component with actual authentication logic (e.g., calling the `/api/auth` endpoint) and secure token handling.
2.  **Implement Authenticated Routes**: Use a standard pattern for protected routes (e.g., a `<PrivateRoute>` component) that checks for a valid authentication token and potentially the user's role before rendering dashboard components. Redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.
3.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Fetch the user's role after login and use it to:
    *   Control access to specific routes (e.g., only users with the 'nurse' role can access `/rn`).
    *   Conditionally render UI elements based on permissions associated with the role.
4.  **Secure Token Storage**: Refactor token handling to avoid `localStorage`. Use HttpOnly cookies managed by the backend or store tokens in memory with appropriate refresh mechanisms.
5.  **Centralize Auth Logic**: Consider implementing an authentication context or using a state management library to manage user authentication state and role information globally within the application.

## Next Steps

*   Examine `Ojala.PatientPortal` and `employer-dashboard` for similar access control patterns or lack thereof.
*   Document these findings in the main audit summary.
