# Third-Party Integrations Audit

## Summary

This audit reviewed the integration of third-party services within the Ojal√° Healthcare Platform, focusing on secure API key management and overall integration security.

## Findings

1.  **Secret Management (Vault)**: The platform utilizes HashiCorp Vault for secret management, as evidenced by `VaultSettings` in various `appsettings.json` files (e.g., Ojala.Api, Ojala.ApiGateway, Ojala.Identity, ai-engine, nurse-assistant). Backend services appear configured to fetch secrets from Vault, which is a strong security practice.

2.  **Payment Processing (Stripe)**: The `src/frontend/patient-app/payment.js` file indicates integration with Stripe. The code structure suggests a `stripeService` dependency is injected during initialization. However, the audit needs to confirm how the Stripe API keys (publishable and secret) are provided to this service. Ideally, the secret key should be handled exclusively by the backend and fetched from Vault, while the publishable key can be configured for the frontend.

3.  **Health Data Import (Apple HealthKit)**: The `src/frontend/patient-app/src/components/HealthKitIntegration.js` file handles integration with Apple HealthKit on iOS. It correctly requests permissions and fetches data. Data is sent to the backend API (`/devices/{deviceId}/healthkit`). Authorization for this API call relies on a `deviceToken` stored in `AsyncStorage`. While `AsyncStorage` is standard for mobile apps, it's not considered secure storage for highly sensitive tokens on its own. The security of this token depends on the overall mobile app security posture (e.g., protection against rooted/jailbroken devices, code obfuscation).

4.  **Cloud Services (AWS/Azure/Google)**: General references to cloud providers were found, but primarily in configuration files related to potential deployment environments or SDKs included via dependencies (e.g., `package-lock.json`). No direct usage of cloud service APIs with hardcoded keys was identified in the application code reviewed so far. Further investigation during the cloud infrastructure review (Step 15) is needed.

5.  **Communication Services (SMS/Email)**: References to `Email` and `SMS` were found, particularly in the `nurse-assistant/appsettings.json` configuration (`Notifications` section). However, the specific service provider (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid) and how API keys are managed (presumably via Vault, based on other configurations) are not explicitly detailed in the reviewed files. Confirmation is needed that these keys are indeed stored in Vault.

6.  **Mapping Services**: No specific integration with mapping services (like Google Maps) or associated API key usage was identified in the core application code reviewed.

## Recommendations

1.  **Confirm Vault Usage**: Verify in the backend code that secrets for Stripe, Email/SMS services, and any other third-party integrations are actively being fetched from Vault and not hardcoded or read from insecure configuration sources.
2.  **Stripe Key Handling**: Ensure the Stripe *secret* key is never exposed to the frontend. Backend APIs should handle interactions requiring the secret key.
3.  **HealthKit `deviceToken` Security**: Evaluate the security implications of storing the `deviceToken` in `AsyncStorage`. Consider using more secure storage mechanisms available on iOS (like Keychain) if the token provides significant privileges.
4.  **Explicit Configuration**: Ensure configurations for Email/SMS services clearly define the provider and confirm keys are managed via Vault.
