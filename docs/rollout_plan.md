## Critical Path Dependencies

1. Auth Bridge → User Authentication Migration → Advanced Security Features
2. AI Integration → Health Score API → Clinical Decision Support → Predictive Models
3. Feature Flag Service → Dashboard Implementations → Care Plans UI → Patient Portal
4. Monitoring Stack → Load Testing → Performance Optimization
5. Data Migration → Analytics → Population Health → Research Exports

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **Technical Risks**:
   - Begin with comprehensive unit testing (80%+ coverage)
   - Implement feature flags for controlled rollout
   - Maintain parallel systems during migration
   - Establish automated rollback procedures

2. **Resource Risks**:
   - Cross-train team members on critical components
   - Document architecture and implementation details
   - Establish knowledge sharing sessions
   - Create detailed onboarding materials

3. **Timeline Risks**:
   - Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features
   - Establish clear acceptance criteria for each deliverable
   - Build buffer time into critical path items
   - Weekly progress tracking with early warning indicators

## Success Metrics

1. **Migration Completion**: 100% of users and data migrated by end of Quarter 3
2. **System Performance**: 99.9% uptime, <500ms API response time
3. **User Adoption**: 95% of users active on new platform by Quarter 4
4. **Clinical Outcomes**: 15% improvement in care plan adherence
5. **Operational Efficiency**: 30% reduction in administrative tasks

## Quarterly Review Process

Each quarter will conclude with:
1. Feature demonstration to stakeholders
2. Performance and security assessment
3. User feedback collection and analysis
4. Adjustment of subsequent quarter priorities if needed
5. Go/no-go decision for next quarter implementation
