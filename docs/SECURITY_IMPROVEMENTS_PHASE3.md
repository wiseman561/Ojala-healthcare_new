# Phase 3 Security Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities identified and the improvements implemented during Phase 3 (Feature Module Security & Tests) of the Ojala Healthcare Platform project.

## 1. Ojala.Api (Backend Service)

### Vulnerabilities Identified:

*   **Overly Permissive CORS:** The default policy allowed any origin, method, and header (`AllowAnyOrigin`, `AllowAnyMethod`, `AllowAnyHeader`), increasing the risk of cross-origin attacks.
*   **Missing Authentication Middleware:** The `UseAuthentication()` middleware was commented out or missing, meaning JWT tokens were not being validated for protected endpoints.
*   **Inconsistent Object-Level Authorization:** Controllers lacked consistent checks to ensure users could only access or modify data belonging to them or patients they are authorized to manage (e.g., a patient accessing another patient's records).
*   **Missing Security Headers:** No standard security headers (like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy`) were being sent, leaving the application vulnerable to clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, and other attacks.
*   **Lack of Anti-Forgery Protection:** No mechanisms were in place to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** No rate limiting was implemented on API endpoints, increasing susceptibility to brute-force attacks and denial-of-service.
*   **Vault Token Handling:** Potential issues in `VaultExtensions.cs` regarding token caching and renewal (similar to Phase 2 findings).

### Improvements Implemented:

*   **Security Tests Added:** Created new test files (`AppointmentsControllerTests.cs`, `PatientsControllerTests.cs`, `MedicalRecordsControllerTests.cs`, `HealthcarePlansControllerTests.cs`, `DashboardControllerTests.cs`) and added security-focused unit tests to `AlertsControllerTests.cs`. These tests cover:
    *   Role-based authorization checks.
    *   Object-level authorization scenarios (e.g., patient accessing own vs. other's data, provider access).
    *   Input validation concerns (e.g., testing potentially malicious search queries).
    *   Placeholders were added where full testing requires integration tests or implementation changes (e.g., `[Authorize]` attribute simulation, detailed object-level checks).
*   **Security Headers Added:** Implemented middleware in `Program.cs` to add the following headers to all responses:
    *   `X-Frame-Options: DENY` (prevents clickjacking).
    *   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (prevents MIME-sniffing).
    *   `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
    *   `Permissions-Policy` (restricts browser feature access, e.g., camera, microphone).
*   **CORS Policy Restricted:** Modified the CORS policy in `Program.cs` to use `WithOrigins()` instead of `AllowAnyOrigin()`. The allowed origins should be configured properly in `appsettings.json` or environment variables for production.

## 2. Ojala.Identity (Backend Service)

### Vulnerabilities Identified:

*   **Simplified Refresh Token Logic:** The `RefreshTokenAsync` implementation in `AuthService.cs` was overly simplistic, potentially reusing tokens or lacking proper validation and rotation.
*   **No Token Revocation:** The `LogoutAsync` method did not implement any server-side token revocation or blacklisting.
*   **Automatic Email Confirmation:** `EmailConfirmed` was set to `true` during registration without an actual verification step.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** No rate limiting on login or registration endpoints.
*   **Insecure JWT Secret Key Handling:** The `TokenService.cs` read the JWT secret key directly from configuration, potentially exposing it.
*   **Development Vault Token Usage:** `VaultExtensions.cs` allowed fallback to a potentially insecure root token (`VAULT_TOKEN`) during development.

### Improvements Implemented:

*   **Security Tests Added:** Created a new `Tests` directory and added test files (`AuthControllerTests.cs`, `AuthServiceTests.cs`, `TokenServiceTests.cs`) with security-focused unit tests covering:
    *   Input validation in `AuthController`.
    *   Authentication logic in `AuthService` (e.g., user exists, password correct, token validation failures).
    *   Token generation and validation logic in `TokenService` (e.g., correct claims, expiry, signature, issuer, audience validation).

## 3. Frontend Modules (Ojala.Web, md-dashboard, etc.)

### Vulnerabilities Identified:

*   **Outdated Dependencies:** `Ojala.Web` used an old version of `react-scripts` (`^3.0.1`), which likely contains known vulnerabilities.
*   **Insecure Token Storage:** Both `Ojala.Web` (`AuthContext.js`) and `md-dashboard` (`useAuth.ts`) stored JWT tokens in `localStorage`, making them vulnerable to theft via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Lack of CSRF Protection:** No explicit CSRF protection mechanisms were observed.
*   **No Refresh Token Mechanism:** Frontend authentication relied solely on the access token stored in `localStorage`, with no mechanism for refreshing expired tokens without requiring the user to log in again.

### Improvements Implemented:

*   **Updated Dependencies:** Updated `react-scripts` in `Ojala.Web/package.json` from `^3.0.1` to `^5.0.1`.
*   **In-Memory Token Storage:** Modified `Ojala.Web/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` and `md-dashboard/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to store the JWT token in an in-memory variable instead of `localStorage`. This significantly reduces the risk of token theft via XSS, although it means the token is lost on page refresh/tab close.

## Further Recommendations (Out of Scope for Phase 3 Implementation):

*   **Implement Refresh Tokens:** Implement a robust refresh token strategy (e.g., storing refresh tokens securely, potentially in HttpOnly cookies) to allow session persistence without storing access tokens insecurely.
*   **Implement CSRF Protection:** Add anti-CSRF tokens to frontend forms and backend validation, especially for state-changing requests.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Add rate limiting to backend API endpoints, particularly authentication endpoints.
*   **Complete Object-Level Authorization:** Fully implement and test object-level authorization checks within all relevant backend controller actions.
*   **Configure Authentication Middleware:** Properly configure and enable `app.UseAuthentication()` in `Ojala.Api`.
*   **Secure JWT Secret:** Store the JWT secret key securely (e.g., in Vault) instead of configuration files.
*   **Implement Email Confirmation:** Add a proper email confirmation flow for user registration.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline (partially addressed in Phase 2, but ensure coverage for all projects).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy header in backend responses to further mitigate XSS risks.
