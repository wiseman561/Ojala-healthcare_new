# Cloud Infrastructure Security Audit

## Summary

This audit reviewed the cloud infrastructure security configurations for the Ojalá Healthcare Platform, focusing on secure VPC/subnet isolation, firewall rules, and storage encryption settings.

## Findings

1. **Kubernetes Deployment Configuration**:
   - The platform uses Kubernetes for deployment, with Helm charts for each service.
   - Production configurations include some security best practices:
     - Non-root user (UID 1000) for containers
     - Read-only root filesystem
     - Privilege escalation prevention
     - Pod anti-affinity for high availability
     - TLS termination via ingress
   - However, several critical security issues were identified:
     - Hardcoded Vault tokens in both development and production values
     - Insufficient container security contexts in non-production environments
     - No network policies defined to restrict pod-to-pod communication

2. **Docker Compose Development Environment**:
   - The `docker-compose.yml` file contains numerous hardcoded credentials:
     - `VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=ojala-root-token`
     - `SA_PASSWORD=OjalaP@ssw0rd!`
     - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_PASSWORD=OjalaP@ssw0rd!`
     - `DOCKER_INFLUXDB_INIT_ADMIN_TOKEN=ojala-influxdb-token`
     - `JWT_SECRET=ojala-device-secret-key` and `JWT_SECRET=ojala-jwt-secret`
   - Vault is running in development mode, which is insecure
   - Services are exposing ports directly to the host
   - No resource limits on most containers

3. **Secret Management**:
   - HashiCorp Vault is used for secret management, which is a good practice
   - However, Vault tokens are hardcoded in configuration files rather than injected via Kubernetes secrets or service accounts
   - No evidence of token rotation or lease management

4. **Network Security**:
   - No explicit network policies found in Kubernetes configurations
   - No evidence of service mesh implementation (like Istio) for mTLS between services
   - Ingress configurations use TLS in production, but internal service communication lacks encryption

5. **Storage Encryption**:
   - No explicit configuration for storage encryption at rest
   - No PersistentVolume configurations with encryption settings
   - Database credentials are hardcoded rather than using Kubernetes secrets

6. **GitOps Configuration**:
   - ArgoCD is used for GitOps deployment, which is a good practice
   - However, no clear separation of secrets from application code

## HIPAA Compliance Gaps

1. **§164.312(a)(1) - Access Control**: The lack of network policies and proper service-to-service authentication creates risks for unauthorized access.

2. **§164.312(a)(2)(iv) - Encryption and Decryption**: No explicit configuration for encryption at rest for persistent volumes containing PHI.

3. **§164.312(c)(1) - Integrity**: No integrity verification mechanisms for deployed artifacts.

4. **§164.312(e)(1) - Transmission Security**: Internal service communication lacks encryption (mTLS).

## Recommendations

1. **Secret Management**:
   - Replace hardcoded Vault tokens with Kubernetes service accounts and Vault's Kubernetes auth method
   - Implement secret rotation for all credentials
   - Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive configuration

2. **Network Security**:
   - Implement Kubernetes Network Policies to restrict pod-to-pod communication
   - Consider implementing a service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) for mTLS between services
   - Restrict egress traffic to only necessary external endpoints

3. **Container Security**:
   - Apply security contexts to all environments, not just production
   - Implement pod security policies or Pod Security Standards (PSS)
   - Add resource limits to all containers to prevent DoS attacks

4. **Storage Security**:
   - Configure encryption at rest for all PersistentVolumes
   - Use StorageClasses that support encryption
   - Implement backup encryption

5. **Infrastructure Hardening**:
   - Implement node hardening with CIS benchmarks
   - Use distroless or minimal base images
   - Implement admission controllers (OPA/Gatekeeper) for policy enforcement

6. **GitOps Security**:
   - Separate secrets from application code
   - Implement sealed secrets or external secret operators
   - Enforce signed commits and image verification

## Next Steps

- Document these findings in the main audit summary.
- Update `todo.md`.
- Prioritize implementing network policies and proper secret management as critical security enhancements.
