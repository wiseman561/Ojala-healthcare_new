# Production Deployment Checklist - Ojala Healthcare Platform

This checklist outlines key steps and considerations for deploying the Ojala Healthcare Platform to a production environment. It incorporates the security, compliance, logging, and monitoring enhancements implemented in previous phases.

## I. Pre-Deployment

### A. Infrastructure Setup & Configuration

*   [ ] **Kubernetes Cluster:** Production cluster provisioned, configured, and secured (network policies, RBAC).
*   [ ] **Database:** Production database instance provisioned, secured (network access, credentials), configured for high availability and backups.
*   [ ] **Vault:** Production Vault instance deployed, configured with appropriate auth methods (Kubernetes auth), policies, and secrets engines. Ensure high availability.
*   [ ] **Monitoring Stack:** Production Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager (or equivalent) deployed and configured.
*   [ ] **Logging Stack:** Production log aggregation system (e.g., EFK/Loki/Splunk) deployed and configured.
*   [ ] **Networking:** Ingress controller configured with TLS termination (valid certificates), security policies (WAF if applicable), and routing rules.
*   [ ] **DNS:** Production DNS records configured for all public-facing services.

### B. Application Configuration & Secrets

*   [ ] **Environment Variables:** All required environment variables for each service defined and securely managed (e.g., via ConfigMaps, Vault).
*   [ ] **Secrets:** All secrets (API keys, database connection strings, JWT signing keys) securely stored in Vault and injected into applications via Vault Agent Injector.
*   [ ] **Helm Charts:** Production `values.yaml` files created for each Helm chart (`api`, `identity`, etc.) with production-specific settings (replicas, resource limits, ingress rules, Vault config).
*   [ ] **CORS Origins:** Allowed CORS origins configured correctly for production frontend URLs in backend service configurations (`Ojala.Api`, `Ojala.Identity`, `Ojala.ApiGateway`).

### C. Build & CI/CD

*   [ ] **CI Pipeline:** Final verification of CI pipeline (`docker-ci.yml`, `ci-cd.yml`) including security scans (Trivy), tests, and image builds.
*   [ ] **Docker Images:** Production-ready Docker images built, tagged, and pushed to a secure container registry.
*   [ ] **Image Scanning:** Final vulnerability scan results for production images reviewed and critical/high vulnerabilities addressed.
*   [ ] **Deployment Strategy:** Deployment strategy confirmed (e.g., RollingUpdate, Blue/Green).

### D. Security & Compliance

*   [ ] **Penetration Testing:** Results from external penetration testing reviewed and critical findings addressed.
*   [ ] **HIPAA Risk Assessment:** Formal HIPAA risk assessment completed and reviewed.
*   [ ] **Business Associate Agreements (BAAs):** BAAs confirmed to be in place with all relevant third-party vendors (cloud provider, etc.).
*   [ ] **Security Contexts:** Kubernetes Security Contexts in deployment manifests verified for least privilege.
*   [ ] **Network Policies:** Kubernetes Network Policies implemented to restrict pod-to-pod communication.

### E. Data

*   [ ] **Data Migration:** Data migration plan (if required) tested and ready for execution.
*   [ ] **Database Seeding:** Production database seeding strategy confirmed (if applicable).
*   [ ] **Backup Strategy:** Database backup strategy verified and tested.

### F. Testing

*   [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** Automated end-to-end tests passed in a staging environment mirroring production.
*   [ ] **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** UAT completed and signed off by stakeholders.
*   [ ] **Load Testing:** Performance and load testing completed against production-like environment.

### G. Planning

*   [ ] **Rollback Plan:** Detailed rollback plan documented and tested.
*   [ ] **Deployment Window:** Deployment window scheduled and communicated.
*   [ ] **Communication Plan:** Communication plan for stakeholders during deployment established.

## II. Deployment Execution

*   [ ] **Environment Freeze:** Non-essential changes to the production environment frozen.
*   [ ] **Pre-Deployment Backups:** Final backups taken (database, configuration).
*   [ ] **Execute Data Migration:** Run data migration scripts (if applicable).
*   [ ] **Deploy Applications:** Deploy applications using Helm charts and CI/CD pipeline.
*   [ ] **Smoke Tests:** Execute automated smoke tests against the production environment.
*   [ ] **Manual Verification:** Perform key manual checks on application functionality.

## III. Post-Deployment

*   [ ] **Monitoring:** Verify monitoring dashboards (Grafana) are receiving metrics from deployed services.
*   [ ] **Logging:** Verify logs are being aggregated correctly in the logging system.
*   [ ] **Alerting:** Verify alerting rules (Alertmanager) are active and configured correctly.
*   [ ] **Remove Old Versions:** Decommission old application versions (if using Blue/Green).
*   [ ] **Post-Deployment Review:** Conduct a post-deployment review meeting.
*   [ ] **Documentation Update:** Update any relevant operational documentation.
*   [ ] **Enable Full Traffic:** Gradually enable or switch full traffic to the new deployment.
*   [ ] **Monitor Closely:** Closely monitor application performance, error rates, and logs for the initial period after deployment.
