## Architecture Overview

The OjalaHealthcarePlatform is built on a modern, microservices-based architecture that enables seamless integration between new and legacy components. The platform consists of three core projects:

- **Ojala.Api**: RESTful API services that provide the backend functionality
- **Ojala.Web**: Frontend web applications for different user roles (RN, MD, Employer, Patient)
- **Ojala.Services**: Shared business logic and integration services

The architecture employs an API Gateway pattern to route requests between legacy and new systems, with feature flags enabling controlled rollout of new functionality.

## Infrastructure Components

### Secrets Management with HashiCorp Vault

Vault provides secure storage and management of sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption keys. The implementation includes:

- Dedicated Vault server with high availability configuration
- Role-based access policies for different application components
- Automatic key rotation and audit logging
- Integration with AWS IAM for authentication

### AWS CloudFormation Templates

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates define the cloud resources required for the platform:

- **network.yml**: VPC, subnets, security groups, and network ACLs
- **ecs-cluster.yml**: ECS cluster for containerized application components
- **rds-instance.yml**: RDS database instances with encryption and backup policies

### CI/CD Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows automate the build, test, and deployment processes:

- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Deployment pipelines for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- Security scanning and compliance checks
- Automated documentation generation

## Integration Strategy

### API Gateway

The Ocelot-based API Gateway serves as the central entry point for all API requests, providing:

- Request routing between legacy and new API endpoints
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- Logging and monitoring

### Authentication Bridge

The authentication bridge enables seamless user authentication across legacy and new systems:

- Token validation and translation
- User identity mapping
- Role-based access control
- Single sign-on capabilities

### AI Engine Integration

Integration with the existing AI engine provides advanced analytics and decision support:

- Health score calculation
- Risk assessment and prediction
- Care plan recommendations
- Outcome forecasting

### Feature Flag Service

The feature flag service enables controlled rollout of new features:

- Global feature toggles
- User-specific feature enablement
- Role-based feature access
- A/B testing capabilities

## Security and Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

The platform is designed to meet HIPAA requirements for protected health information (PHI):

- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Role-based access controls
- Data masking and anonymization

### Security Testing

Automated security testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing scripts
- Compliance verification

## Testing Framework

### Unit and Integration Tests

Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability and correctness:

- xUnit tests for backend services
- Integration tests using WebApplicationFactory
- Mock services for external dependencies
- Continuous testing in CI pipeline

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

Cypress tests verify the functionality of user interfaces and workflows:

- RN dashboard and patient management
- MD care plan creation and approval
- Employer dashboard and reporting
- Patient onboarding and self-service

### Load Testing with k6

Performance testing ensures the platform can handle expected load:

- Simulated user scenarios for different roles
- Gradual ramp-up to peak load
- Performance thresholds for response time and error rate
- Integration with monitoring for analysis

## Monitoring and Observability

### Prometheus and Grafana

Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility into system health and performance:

- Real-time metrics collection
- Custom dashboards for different service components
- Alerting rules for performance and availability issues
- Historical trend analysis

### Logging and Tracing

Distributed tracing enables troubleshooting across service boundaries:

- Centralized log aggregation
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Performance profiling
- Error analysis and alerting

## Deployment Guide

### Environment Setup

Instructions for setting up development, staging, and production environments:

- Infrastructure provisioning with CloudFormation
- Container deployment with ECS
- Database initialization and migration
- Secrets configuration with Vault

### Deployment Process

Step-by-step deployment procedures for different components:

- API services deployment
- Web application deployment
- Database schema updates
- Configuration management

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration

Procedures for migrating data from legacy systems:

- ETL processes for patient records
- User account migration
- Historical data preservation
- Validation and verification

### Phased Rollout

Strategy for gradually transitioning from legacy to new systems:

- Component-by-component migration
- Parallel operation during transition
- Feature flag-controlled user migration
- Rollback procedures
