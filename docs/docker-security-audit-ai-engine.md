# Docker Security Audit - ai-engine

## Security Issues Found

1. **Missing requirements.txt file**: The Dockerfile references a requirements.txt file that doesn't exist in the repository. This could lead to build failures or inconsistent deployments.

2. **Unpinned Node.js base image**: Using `node:18-slim` without a specific version tag allows for potential drift in dependencies when rebuilding.

3. **Unpinned Python base image**: Using `python:3.9-slim` without a specific version tag allows for potential drift in dependencies when rebuilding.

4. **Unpinned npm dependencies**: The Dockerfile installs dependencies without pinning versions (especially OpenAI which is installed separately).

5. **No vulnerability scanning during build**: No security scanning is integrated into the build process.

## Recommendations

1. **Pin base image versions precisely**:
   - Change `FROM node:18-slim` to `FROM node:18.19.1-slim` (or latest LTS)
   - Change `FROM python:3.9-slim` to `FROM python:3.9.18-slim` (or latest patch)

2. **Create missing requirements.txt file** with pinned versions of all Python dependencies.

3. **Pin npm package versions** in package.json and package-lock.json.

4. **Add .dockerignore file** to prevent unnecessary files from being included in the build context.

5. **Implement security scanning** during CI/CD pipeline.

6. **Add additional security hardening**:
   - Set NODE_ENV=production explicitly
   - Add least privilege file permissions
   - Remove unnecessary tools after installation
   - Consider adding Content-Security-Policy headers

7. **Implement secrets management** using environment variables instead of files in /vault/secrets.

## Positive Security Practices Already Implemented

1. **Multi-stage build** to reduce final image size
2. **Non-root user** (appuser) for running the application
3. **Health check** implementation
4. **Clean up of apt cache** to reduce image size
5. **Proper ownership** of application files
