   - Predictive risk scoring
   - NLP note summarization
   - Population health and cohort analysis
   - Integrated telehealth and messaging
   - Wearables and device data integration
   - Caregiver and family portal
   - Gamified adherence and education

3. **Technical Requirements:**
   - JWT authentication
   - Entity Framework Core with SQL Server
   - Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - TypeScript API client
   - Internationalization support
   - Caching with Redis
   - GraphQL gateway
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Integration Strategy

### 1. Architecture Approach

We will adopt a hybrid approach that preserves valuable components from the existing platform while transitioning to the new architecture:

**Short-term (0-3 months):**
- Create the new OjalaHealthcarePlatform solution structure
- Implement API gateway pattern to route requests between existing and new services
- Develop shared authentication mechanism between systems
- Begin migrating high-value, low-complexity components

**Medium-term (3-6 months):**
- Gradually replace existing backend services with new implementations
- Implement shared data access layer with compatibility for both systems
- Develop new frontend components while maintaining existing dashboards
- Create comprehensive test suite covering both systems

**Long-term (6-12 months):**
- Complete migration to new architecture
- Decommission legacy components
- Optimize performance and scalability
- Enhance with advanced features

### 2. Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- Primary: ASP.NET Core Web API
- Secondary: Node.js (for compatibility with existing services)
- Database: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- Caching: Redis
- Message Broker: RabbitMQ
- AI/ML: Python with TensorFlow/PyTorch

**Frontend:**
- Primary: React with TypeScript
- State Management: Redux
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS
- Mobile: React Native

**DevOps:**
- Containerization: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Grafana, Prometheus, ELK Stack
- Error Tracking: Sentry

### 3. Component Integration Plan

#### AI Engine Integration
- Wrap existing AI engine in API endpoints compatible with new architecture
- Gradually refactor health scoring and risk models to new platform
- Implement shared data models between systems

#### Authentication & Security
- Implement JWT authentication in new platform
- Create identity bridge between existing and new auth systems
- Gradually migrate users to new authentication system
- Implement RBAC and contextual permissions

#### Dashboard Integration
- Create new dashboard shells following OjalaHealthcarePlatform requirements
- Embed existing dashboard components within new shells initially
- Gradually replace with new implementations
- Ensure consistent UX across all dashboards

#### Patient Experience
- Develop new patient app with enhanced features
- Implement data synchronization between existing and new patient interfaces
- Gradually transition users to new patient experience

### 4. Feature Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Foundations):**
1. Core infrastructure setup
2. Authentication and security
3. Basic dashboard frameworks
4. API gateway and service communication

**Phase 2 (Core Clinical Features):**
1. Dynamic care plans
2. Smart triage and escalation
3. Health scoring and risk models
4. Basic telehealth capabilities

**Phase 3 (Advanced Features):**
1. NLP note summarization
2. Population health analytics
3. Wearables integration
4. Caregiver portal

**Phase 4 (Optimization & Enhancement):**
1. Performance optimization
2. Advanced analytics
3. Gamification
4. Internationalization

### 5. Data Migration Strategy

- Implement data access layer with adapters for both systems
- Create ETL processes for migrating data between systems
- Ensure data integrity and validation during migration
- Implement comprehensive audit logging for all data changes

### 6. Testing Strategy

- Develop comprehensive test suite covering both systems
- Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Conduct regular security and performance testing
- Establish QA environments mirroring production

### 7. Deployment Strategy

- Implement containerization for all services
- Configure Kubernetes for orchestration
- Set up blue/green deployment for zero downtime
- Implement feature flags for controlled rollouts

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Complexity:** Mitigate through phased approach and comprehensive testing
- **Performance Degradation:** Monitor closely during transition, optimize critical paths
- **Data Integrity Issues:** Implement validation and reconciliation processes

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption:** Provide comprehensive training and support
- **Service Disruption:** Implement careful change management and rollback procedures
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure all changes maintain compliance with healthcare regulations

## Success Metrics

- Successful migration of all critical features
- Zero data loss during transition
- Improved performance metrics (response time, throughput)
- Enhanced user satisfaction (measured through surveys)
- Increased platform adoption and engagement
- Reduced maintenance costs
