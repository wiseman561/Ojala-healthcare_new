# Summary of CI/CD Overhaul and Infrastructure Generation for Ojalá Healthcare / PHOS Platform

This document summarizes the changes made to the **ci-workflows** branch of the Ojalá Healthcare / PHOS platform. The primary goals were to audit and refactor the CI/CD layer, fix failing tests, modernize configurations, add quality gates, generate missing infrastructure files, and ensure the system is ready for automated, no-manual-step deployments.

## 1. CI/CD Layer Audit & Refactor (Goal 1)

The existing CI/CD layer, primarily within `.github/workflows/`, was reviewed and significantly refactored to meet modern standards and project requirements.

### Changes Made:

*   **Workflow Consolidation & Enhancement (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):**
    *   The main CI workflow was overhauled to manage build, test, lint, package, and image push preparations.
    *   **Matrix Strategy:** Implemented GitHub Actions Matrix strategy for:
        *   **.NET Backend:** Builds and tests run on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest` using .NET SDK 8.0.x.
        *   **Node.js Frontend:** Builds and tests run on `ubuntu-latest` using Node.js 20.x.
    *   **Separated Jobs:** Backend (.NET) and Frontend (Node.js) CI processes are now distinct jobs with clear steps for:
        *   Code checkout.
        *   Environment setup (SDKs, Node.js with caching).
        *   Dependency installation (`dotnet restore`, `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps`).
        *   Build (`dotnet build`, `npm run build`).
        *   Testing (`dotnet test`, `npm test -- --coverage`).
        *   Artifact Upload: Test results (TRX for .NET, JUnit XML for Jest) and coverage reports (OpenCover for .NET, LCOV/JSON/Clover for Jest) are uploaded for review and further processing.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Placeholders for Docker registry credentials (`${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}`, `${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}`) were included in commented-out Docker build/push job examples, adhering to the no-hardcoded-secrets constraint.
*   **Docker Image Optimization:**
    *   Reviewed and updated Dockerfiles for key backend services (`src/backend/Ojala.Api/Dockerfile`, `src/backend/Ojala.Identity/Dockerfile`):
        *   Upgraded base images to .NET 8 (e.g., `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0-bullseye-slim`, `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0-bullseye-slim`).
        *   Enhanced multi-stage builds to optimize image size and build times, focusing on layer caching for dependencies.
        *   Implemented non-root user execution for improved security.
        *   Added publish flags (`-p:PublishTrimmed=true`) to reduce final image size, aiming for the <300MB target.
        *   Standardized health check paths to `/healthz`.
    *   The frontend Dockerfile (`src/frontend/ojala.web/Dockerfile`) was reviewed and already employed a multi-stage build with Nginx; it was updated to use Node 20 for the build stage to align with CI.
*   **Cleanup Workflow (`.github/workflows/cleanup.yml`):**
    *   Reviewed and updated for clarity, ensuring it uses Node.js 20.x and correctly targets the root `package-lock.json` for caching if applicable to the cleanup script dependencies.
*   **Security Scanning Workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` merged into `ci.yml`):**
    *   GitHub CodeQL analysis was integrated directly into the main `ci.yml` workflow.
    *   It runs for both `csharp` (backend) and `javascript` (frontend) languages.
    *   Includes steps for initializing CodeQL, autobuilding for C#, and manual build steps for JavaScript to ensure accurate analysis.

### Rationale:

These changes establish a robust, automated CI pipeline that builds and tests the application across different environments consistently. The matrix strategy ensures compatibility, while optimized Docker builds prepare the application for efficient deployment. Artifact uploads provide necessary data for quality checks and debugging.

## 2. Fix Failing Unit Tests (Goal 2)

*   **Backend (.NET):**
    *   Initial `dotnet test` failures were due to the CI environment missing the .NET 8 SDK. After installing `dotnet-sdk-8.0` in the sandbox (and ensuring `setup-dotnet@v4` in CI), all 15 previously failing backend tests passed without requiring code modifications to the tests themselves. The original report of 15/49 failing tests indicated these were the backend ones.
*   **Frontend (React/Jest):**
    *   No pre-existing frontend unit tests were found under `src/frontend/ojala.web/src/`. The remaining (49-15 = 34) tests mentioned in the prompt were assumed to be frontend tests that were missing.
    *   Two placeholder test files were created:
        *   `src/frontend/ojala.web/src/components/ProtectedRoute.test.tsx`
        *   `src/frontend/ojala.web/src/components/PrivateRoute.test.js`
    *   These initially failed due to Jest configuration issues related to ESM, JSX, and module transforms, which were subsequently addressed in Goal 3.

### Rationale:

Ensuring a green test suite is fundamental. The backend tests were confirmed to be sound once the correct runtime was available. The creation of initial frontend tests provides a baseline and a pattern for future test development, which became runnable after Jest modernization.

## 3. Modernize Jest Configuration (Goal 3)

The Jest configuration for the frontend application (`src/frontend/ojala.web`) was modernized to support current JavaScript features and improve the testing workflow.

### Changes Made (`src/frontend/ojala.web/craco.config.js`):

*   **ESM & JSX Support:**
    *   Added `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` to Babel plugins to correctly process JSX syntax outside of CRA default handling if needed, especially for `.js` files that might contain JSX.
    *   Adjusted `jestConfig.transformIgnorePatterns` to ensure `node_modules` (except specific ones like `axios`) are not transformed, while local code is.
*   **Code Coverage:**
    *   Enabled `collectCoverage: true`.
    *   Configured `coverageReporters` to include `json`, `lcov`, `text`, `clover`, and importantly `text-summary` for easy CI checks.
    *   Set `coverageDirectory` to `coverage`.
    *   **Enforced Coverage Threshold:** Added `coverageThreshold` to enforce a minimum of 80% for `branches`, `functions`, `lines`, and `statements` globally.
*   **Watch Mode:** Jest inherently supports watch mode (`npm test -- --watch`), and the configuration changes do not impede this.
*   **Deprecated Options:** No explicitly deprecated Jest options were identified for removal in the existing `craco.config.js`; the focus was on adding necessary configurations.

### Rationale:

A modern Jest setup allows developers to write tests using current JavaScript/TypeScript features and provides reliable code coverage metrics. Enforcing a coverage threshold helps maintain code quality over time.

## 4. Add Quality Gates (Goal 4)

Several quality gates were integrated into the CI pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and adherence to standards.

### Changes Made (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and project configurations):

*   **Code Coverage Enforcement (≥80%):**
    *   **Frontend:** Enforced directly via `coverageThreshold` in `src/frontend/ojala.web/craco.config.js`. The `npm test -- --coverage` command in CI will fail if this threshold is not met.
    *   **Backend:** `dotnet test` was configured to collect coverage data in OpenCover format (`/p:CollectCoverage=true /p:CoverletOutputFormat=opencover`). *TODO: A dedicated step/script to parse this report and enforce the 80% threshold in the CI workflow is still needed for the backend.*
*   **Linting:**
    *   **Frontend (ESLint):**
        *   Installed ESLint, `eslint-config-react-app`, and relevant plugins (`@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, etc.) in `src/frontend/ojala.web`.
        *   Added an `npm run lint` script to `src/frontend/ojala.web/package.json` (`eslint . --ext .js,.jsx,.ts,.tsx --report-unused-disable-directives --max-warnings 0`).
        *   Integrated an "Lint (Frontend)" step in the `frontend-ci` job in `ci.yml` that runs `npm run lint`. This step will fail the build if linting errors (or warnings, due to `--max-warnings 0`) occur.
    *   **Backend (StyleCop/Equivalent):**
        *   *TODO: A .NET linter like StyleCop needs to be configured for the backend projects, and a corresponding linting step added to the `backend-ci` job in `ci.yml`.* The workflow contains a placeholder comment for this.
*   **Security Scanning (SAST):**
    *   GitHub CodeQL analysis is configured in `ci.yml` for both `csharp` and `javascript` codebases. This provides automated security vulnerability detection on each push/PR.

### Rationale:

Quality gates are crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase. Automated linting enforces coding standards, coverage thresholds ensure adequate testing, and security scanning helps identify vulnerabilities early.

## 5. Generate Missing Infrastructure Files (Goal 5)

Several infrastructure files were generated to support local development and prepare for cloud deployments.

### Files Created:

*   **`docker-compose.yml` (at project root):**
    *   Defines services for local development, including:
        *   `ojala-identity` (backend .NET service)
        *   `ojala-api` (backend .NET service)
        *   `ojala-web` (frontend React app served via Nginx)
        *   `ojala-db` (PostgreSQL database)
        *   `ojala-redis` (Redis cache)
    *   Uses Dockerfiles from the respective service directories.
    *   Sets up basic networking and port mappings.
    *   References environment variables that would be defined in a local `.env` file (based on `.env.example`).
*   **`.env.example` (at project root):**
    *   Provides a template for necessary environment variables for all services (database credentials, JWT secrets, API URLs, Redis host, etc.).
    *   Differentiates between variables for local/development and those that should be managed as secrets in production.
*   **Kubernetes Manifests (`infrastructure/kubernetes/services/`):**
    *   Generated YAML manifests for deploying core services to Kubernetes:
        *   `ojala-identity.yml` (Deployment, Service)
        *   `ojala-api.yml` (Deployment, Service)
        *   `ojala-web.yml` (Deployment, Service with LoadBalancer)
        *   `ojala-db.yml` (StatefulSet for PostgreSQL, Service)
        *   `ojala-redis.yml` (Deployment for Redis, Service)
    *   Manifests include basic configurations for replicas, ports, environment variables (referencing ConfigMaps/Secrets), resource requests/limits, and liveness/readiness probes.
    *   Assumes a namespace `ojala-ns` and references image names like `yourdockerhubuser/servicename:latest` which should be replaced by actual CI-built image URIs.
*   **Terraform IaC Stubs (`infrastructure/terraform/`):**
    *   Created a directory structure for `staging` and `production` environments.
    *   **Staging Environment (`infrastructure/terraform/staging/`):**
        *   `main.tf`: Defines providers (AWS example), backend (S3 placeholder), and calls to reusable modules.
        *   `variables.tf`: Root variables for the staging environment.
        *   `modules/network/`: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf` for VPC, subnets, IGW, NAT Gateways.
        *   `modules/database/`: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf` for an RDS PostgreSQL instance.
        *   `modules/app_service/`: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf` for a generic application service (example using ECS Fargate).
    *   **Production Environment (`infrastructure/terraform/production/`):**
        *   `main.tf`: Similar structure to staging `main.tf`, but would use production-specific parameters for module calls (e.g., larger instance sizes, higher replica counts, Multi-AZ for database).
        *   *It is assumed that the `modules` directory (network, database, app_service) would be copied or adapted from staging for production use, with configurations driven by variables passed from the root `production/main.tf`.*

### Rationale:

These files provide the scaffolding for consistent local development (`docker-compose.yml`), container orchestration (`kubernetes/`), and infrastructure as code (`terraform/`) for cloud environments. This promotes reproducibility and simplifies environment setup.

## 6. Project Structure & Naming Conventions

*   Existing naming conventions (`Ojala.*`, `PHOS.*`) were followed where applicable (e.g., in service names, Docker image placeholders).
*   No breaking changes were made to the existing project structure or namespaces.
*   Generated infrastructure files were placed in a new top-level `infrastructure/` directory, with subdirectories for `kubernetes` and `terraform`.

## TODOs & Next Steps

While significant progress has been made, the following items remain as TODOs or require further attention:

1.  **Backend Linting (StyleCop):**
    *   Integrate StyleCop or another .NET linter into the backend projects.
    *   Add a linting step to the `backend-ci` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and ensure it acts as a quality gate.
2.  **Backend Coverage Enforcement:**
    *   Implement a mechanism in the `backend-ci` job to parse the generated OpenCover report and fail the build if the 80% coverage threshold is not met.
3.  **Docker Image Pushing:**
    *   Complete the Docker build-and-push job sections in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (currently commented out placeholders).
    *   This requires setting up `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets in GitHub repository settings.
    *   Define actual Docker image names and tags (e.g., using commit SHA or semantic versioning).
    *   Review and update *all* service Dockerfiles to .NET 8 and apply optimizations similar to `Ojala.Api` and `Ojala.Identity`.
4.  **Kubernetes Manifests - ConfigMaps & Secrets:**
    *   While manifests reference ConfigMaps and Secrets, the actual YAML definitions for these were not generated. These should be created based on `.env.example` and managed securely (e.g., using a secrets manager like HashiCorp Vault, SOPS, or K8s native secrets populated via CI).
    *   Replace placeholder image names in K8s deployments with actual image URIs from the container registry.
5.  **Terraform Modules - Production & Detail:**
    *   Fully flesh out the Terraform modules for the `production` environment by copying/adapting from `staging` and ensuring all configurations are production-grade (e.g., IAM roles, ALB setup for app_service, logging, monitoring, actual instance types, HA configurations).
    *   The `app_service` Terraform module is a basic ECS Fargate example; it needs to be expanded with proper IAM roles (e.g., `ecs_task_execution_role`), Load Balancer configurations, and robust logging/monitoring.
    *   Configure Terraform backend properly (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB for locking) instead of the placeholder comments.
    *   Populate Terraform variables (`.tfvars` files, not committed) or use CI/CD variables for sensitive inputs.
6.  **Frontend Test Refinement:**
    *   The created frontend tests are placeholders. Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for React components and application logic.
7.  **Conventional Commits:**
    *   This summary and the future PR should adhere to Conventional Commits style (e.g., `ci:`, `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`).
8.  **CI Workflow - Deployment Steps:**
    *   Add deployment steps to the CI workflow (e.g., `kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/` or `terraform apply`) for staging and production environments, triggered on appropriate conditions (e.g., merge to `main` or specific tags).
    *   This will require secrets for Kubernetes cluster access (`KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING`, `KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION`) and Terraform execution (`TF_API_TOKEN` or cloud provider credentials).

This overhaul provides a strong foundation for the Ojalá Healthcare / PHOS platform's development and deployment lifecycle. Addressing the TODOs will further enhance its robustness and automation.
